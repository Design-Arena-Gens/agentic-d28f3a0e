        <h2><span className="icon">📖</span> His Life & Legacy</h2>
        <p>
          Saint Nicholas of Myra (270-343 AD) was a Christian bishop who lived in what is now modern-day Turkey.
          Born into a wealthy family, he inherited a fortune when his parents died during an epidemic. Rather than
          keeping this wealth for himself, Nicholas dedicated his life to helping the poor, sick, and suffering.
        </p>
        <p>
          Known for his extraordinary generosity, Nicholas would often give gifts anonymously, delivering them
          secretly at night so that the recipients would not know who their benefactor was. This humble approach
          to charity demonstrated his belief that giving should be done without seeking recognition or praise.
        </p>
        <p>
          His most famous act of charity involved saving three young women from a life of destitution by secretly
          providing them with dowries, allowing them to marry and live honorable lives. According to legend, he
          tossed bags of gold through their window at night, and one landed in a stocking hung by the fireplace to
          dry—beginning the tradition of Christmas stockings.
